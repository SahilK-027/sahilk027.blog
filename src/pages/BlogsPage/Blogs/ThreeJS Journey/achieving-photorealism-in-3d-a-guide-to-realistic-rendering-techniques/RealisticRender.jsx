              If you've ever imported a 3D model into a web project, you‚Äôve
              likely faced this frustration: the render never quite matches how
              it looked in Blender‚Äîor any other 3D software. As a developer, I
              understand how disheartening this can be.
            </p>

            />
            <p className="open-txt">
              But, but, but, there are valid reasons for this disparity. First,
              Blender and similar tools use advanced rendering techniques that
              take significant time to compute (rendering usually takes anywhere
              from a few seconds to several hours or even days in extreme
              cases)‚Äîtime we simply can‚Äôt afford in web-based 3D rendering,
              where every millisecond counts. Additionally, different rendering
              engines handle lighting and materials in unique ways, contributing
              to inconsistencies.
              <br />
              <br />
              However, if you aim to replicate the Blender render as closely as
              possible, there‚Äôs a handy trick called *baking*. In essence,
              baking involves UV unwrapping your 3D model and capturing
              Blender‚Äôs rendered details into a texture. This texture can then
              be applied to your model in your web scene. It‚Äôs a clever way to
              bring pre-rendered realism to your 3D content.
            </p>

              description={`Fig(2.0) Rendering with baked textures`}
            />
            <p className="open-txt">
              But baking alone isn‚Äôt always enough for truly realistic renders.
              Whether you‚Äôre showcasing a real-life product, presenting a
              portfolio as a 3D artist, or simply striving for visual fidelity,
              achieving a life-like appearance requires a combination of
              techniques. Factors like lighting, environment mapping, shadows,
              and material properties all play critical roles‚Äîand when not
              handled correctly, even a great model can look underwhelming.

                    .
                  </li>
                </ul>
                Keep in mind, though, that some of these techniques may impact
                performance or vary depending on your model. Adapting to your
                specific use case is key.
                <br />
                With that said, let‚Äôs dive in and transform your web-based 3D
                models into visually stunning realistic render! üèÅ

            <div className="blog-section">
              <h3 className="blog-section-title">Setup for the code</h3>
              <p>
                To showcase realistic rendering techniques, you can use any 3D
                model, but it‚Äôs ideal to pick one that comes with textures,
                normal maps, and other details. For this example, we‚Äôll use a{" "}
                <a
                  href="https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/sea-turtle-ddb6789834f0412090863e8fd3c0c4db"
                  target="_blank"
                  className="link"
                >
                  Sea Turtle
                </a>{" "}
                model from Sketchfab.
              </p>
              <p>
                The model is lightweight‚Äîjust 900KB after compression (including
                all textures). This demonstrates that you don‚Äôt need heavy,
                uncompressed models to achieve stunning results. A
                well-optimized, small model can still deliver impressive
                realism. I‚Äôve already downloaded the Sea Turtle and saved it in
                the <code>/static/models/</code> folder. It‚Äôs loaded and added
                to the scene, ready to work with.
              </p>
              <p>
                To refine our render, we‚Äôll use lil-gui, a handy tool for
                tweaking various parameters in real-time. This level of control
                is essential when striving for a perfect render, allowing
                adjustments to lighting, material properties, and
                post-processing effects without diving back into the code
                repeatedly.
