  Ohh, while discussing the future proofing, I just remembered a small story about it.
  </p>
  <br />
  <p>
  In 1996, the launch of the Ariane 5 rocket by the European Space Agency ended in tragedy within 40 seconds due to a critical oversight. The engineers who wrote the code for Ariane 5 reused outdated code from Ariane 4, which was designed for lower velocities. Ariane 4 used 16-bit number architecture, while Ariane 5 was designed for much higher velocities that could exceed the 16-bit number limit. During the flight, a 64-bit floating point velocity measurement was converted to a 16-bit signed integer, causing an integer overflow. This error disrupted the guidance system, resulting in incorrect course adjustments, full nozzle deflections, and ultimately, the rocket's destruction—a loss of €500 million. This incident underscores the critical need for meticulous data representation in computers.

                The computer has its smallest unit to store the data. The unit
                is called Register. A register is a small, fast storage location
                within the CPU used to hold data temporarily. Generally, we have
                an 8-bit Register, 16-bit Register, 32-bit Register, 64-bit
                Register, and that is why the computer has different
                architectures like 32-bit and 64-bit architecture. We can
                generally say that a computer with a 32-bit architecture has
                32-bit registers.

              <p>
                You might have observed one thing, to store the number 14
                computer would only need 4 bits, but usually we use standardized
                bit architectures such as min 8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit, and 64-bit.
                The question arises, why standardize? Doesn't this lead to an
                increase in the use of redundant 0s? Are we wasting space?
              </p>

              <p>
                You're correct, using larger registers, such as 64-bit instead
                of 32-bit, can lead to more space being used to represent
                smaller numbers, potentially resulting in more zeros (redundant
                bits). This can seem like wasted space at first glance. However,
                there are important reasons why computers use larger registers
                despite this apparent inefficiency:

              <h4 className="sub-title">Binary Subtraction</h4>
              <p>
                Binary subtraction, like binary addition, follows specific rules
                and involves borrowing when needed. Here are the basic rules for
                binary subtraction:
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <i className="fa-solid fa-arrow-right"></i>{" "}
                    <b>0 - 0 = 0:</b> Subtracting zero from zero yields zero.

                  <li>
                    <i className="fa-solid fa-arrow-right"></i>{" "}
                    <b>1 - 0 = 1:</b> Subtracting zero from one yields one.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <i className="fa-solid fa-arrow-right"></i>{" "}
                    <b>1 - 1 = 0:</b> Subtracting one from one yields zero.

                  <li>
                    <i className="fa-solid fa-arrow-right"></i> <b>0 - 1:</b>{" "}
                    Requires borrowing from the next higher bit.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </p>

              <h4 className="sub-title">Borrow Concept</h4>
              <p>
                Borrowing in binary subtraction occurs when you subtract a
                larger digit from a smaller one. You borrow 1 from the next
                higher bit, which is equivalent to 2 in binary (since 10 in
                binary equals 2 in decimal).

              <h4 className="sub-title">1's Complement</h4>
              <p>
                To find the 1's complement, flip all the bits (0 becomes 1, and
                1 becomes 0).

                systems to represent signed integers. It is especially useful
                because it simplifies the design of arithmetic logic units
                (ALUs) in digital computers, making it possible to perform both
                addition and subtraction operations easily.

                How Numbers are Represented in Computer
              </h3>
              <p>
                In computer science, one topic that has always confused me is
                how numbers are stored in a computer. How can computers
                differentiate between +1 and -1?
              </p>
              <p>Let’s solve this mystery once and for all.</p>
              <InfoDiv infoText={infoNote3} />

              <p>
                As we have discussed in previous sections, in the standard C/C++
                language, we see 32-bit or 64-bit integers. 32-bit integers are
                declared using the int keyword, while 64-bit integers are
                declared using the long keyword.
                <br />
                So when we write:
              </p>
              <CodeSnippet codeText={code3} theme={theme} language="cpp" />
              <p>
                You can simply imagine a 32-bit integer as an array of 32
                blocks, with each block having a size of 1 bit, similar to how
                we imagined a 32-bit register.
                <br />
                Now each bit value can be set (1) or unset (0). With this logic,
                what can be the maximum value that we can store inside a 32-bit
                integer? You might say that if this bit array has a maximum size
                of 32 bits, then to get the maximum number, we should set all 32
                bits to 1. Absolutely right 👍.
                <br />
                So the maximum 32-bit integer number becomes all 32 1s.
              </p>

                description={`Fig(2.0) UINT_MAX value representation in 32-bit integer.`}
              />
              <p>
                This number is 4294967295, which in C++ as a programming
                language is called UINT_MAX. Now, if I ask what can be the
                minimum value we can store inside a 32-bit integer? You will say
                to assign all bits with 0s (also called: unset them all). The
                number becomes 0. So we can easily conclude that any 32-bit
                integer can hold any number between the range [0, 4294967295],
                i.e. [0, UINT_MAX].
              </p>
              <p>Wait, wait, wait...</p>
              <p>
                Sahil, you explained all the positive numbers, but how can we
                store -1, -3, or any other negative number in this 32-bit
                integer then? Yes, that’s the confusion I was talking about at
                the very beginning of this section. Let’s remove all the
                confusion. As of now, we have the idea that the total number of
                integers we can store in 32-bit integers is 4294967295. Let’s
                draw it on a number line. What if we split this line into two
                halves?
              </p>
              <p>
                Such that the first half will hold numbers from [0, 4294967295 /
                2].
                <br />
                The second half will hold numbers from [-(4294967295 / 2), -1].
              </p>
              <BlogImage
                imgDark={img3}
                imgLight={img3l}
                theme={theme}
                description={`Fig(3.0) Integer representation on a number line.`}
              />
              <p>
                But 4294967295 in itself an odd number so we cannot divide it
                completely by two. So more sophisticatedly we can divide our
                ranges as:
                <br />
                <b>[-2714483648, -1] —- [0, 2714483647]</b>
                <br />
                So if you want to know the total numbers in this range are:
                <br />
                <b>2714483647 - (-2714483648) == 4294967295</b>
              </p>
              <p>
                Hurrey 🥳, problem solved! Now we have a way to represent at
                least half of the negative numbers in 32-bit INTEGER.
              </p>

              <h4 className="sub-title">Signed and Unsigned Integers</h4>
              <p>
                So finally we got our way out. The solution is to represent the
                negative numbers and positive numbers in a computer. But this
                solution ended up creating two whole new categories of numbers.
                Signed Integers and Unsigned Integers.

                Representation of signed integers in computer.
              </h3>
              <p>
                From what we have learned so far, it’s very easy to understand
                how computers might represent unsigned integers. (i.e. Intergers
                in range [0, UINT_MAX]). By simply using all 32 bits and
                creating all the possible combinations of 0s and 1s to fill the
                gap and generate the numbers.
              </p>
              <p>
                But still, one question remains in our minds. How can we
                represent negative numbers in memory?
              </p>
              <p>
                So far what we have seen we have divided the whole range of
                unsigned integers into 2 to get half positive and half negative
                numbers to represent in signed integers group. Now if I ask you
                to take the maximum positive number from this range, that will
                be 2147283647, and represent it in its binary form, the number
                will look as: <b>01111111111111111111111111111111</b>
              </p>
              <p>
                So we can see we can still have 1 rightmost bit unused. One
                thing to note to represent the 2147283647 max signed integer we
                only require 31 bits. So can we use the last 32nd bit to
                differentiate the positive and negative numbers? Absolutely YES!
                And that’s what computer scientists across the globe would have
                thought initially.{" "}
              </p>
              <p>
                They gave this 32nd bit (MSB)the bit name SIGN-BIT. If for any
                signed integer the MSBth bit is 0 means the number is positive
                and if the MSBth bit is 1 it is a negative number.{" "}

                Cyclic nature of integer representation. Why does 2s complement
                represent negative numbers?
              </h3>
              <p>
                The cyclic nature of integers in computing arises due to the way
                integers are represented and stored in computer systems,
                specifically using fixed-size binary numbers. This phenomenon is
                particularly evident in systems that use two's complement
                representation for signed integers.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>Like why INT_MAX + 1 == INT_MIN?</b>
              </p>
              <p>
                Let's break down why adding 1 to the maximum integer value
                results in the minimum integer value in such systems.
              </p>
              <h4>Two's Complement Representation</h4>
              <p>
                Two's complement is the most common method for representing
                signed integers in binary. It allows for a simple binary
                arithmetic process and makes the representation of negative
                numbers straightforward.
              </p>
              <h4>Fixed Size Integers</h4>
              <p>
                In a typical 32-bit system:
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <i className="fa-solid fa-arrow-right"></i> The integer
                    range is from <b> −2^31 to 2^31 − 1</b>.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <i className="fa-solid fa-arrow-right"></i> The maximum
                    integer value <b>(`INT_MAX`) is 2^31−1</b>.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <i className="fa-solid fa-arrow-right"></i> The minimum
                    integer value <b>(`INT_MIN`) is −2^31</b>.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </p>
              <h4>Binary Representation</h4>
              <p>
                For a 32-bit integer:
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <i className="fa-solid fa-arrow-right"></i> `INT_MAX`
                    (2147483647) in binary is: `01111111 11111111 11111111
                    11111111`.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <i className="fa-solid fa-arrow-right"></i> `INT_MIN`
                    (-2147483648) in binary is: `10000000 00000000 00000000
                    00000000`.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </p>
              <h4>Integer Overflow</h4>
              <p>
                When you add 1 to `INT_MAX`, you get: `01111111 11111111
                11111111 11111111`+ 1 = `10000000 00000000 00000000 00000000`
              </p>
              <h4>Interpreting the Result</h4>
              <p>
                In two's complement, the most significant bit (MSB) is the sign
                bit. A 0 in the MSB indicates a positive number, while a 1
                indicates a negative number. - The binary number `10000000
                00000000 00000000 00000000` represents −2^31 in two's
                complement, which is `INT_MIN`.
