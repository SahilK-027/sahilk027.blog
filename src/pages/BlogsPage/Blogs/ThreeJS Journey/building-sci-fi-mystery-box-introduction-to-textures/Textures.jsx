                Bored with your purple sphere yet? It's time to add some
                textures. We will create a cool looking SCI-FI mystery box,
                looking at first it might seem advance to you but don't worry
                it's damn easy to build.
                <br />
                When working with 3D models, different types of textures are
                used to create a realistic and detailed appearance by simulating
                various surface characteristics. Below are explanations of the
                common types of textures:
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <i className="fa-solid fa-arrow-right"></i>{" "}
                    <b>Ambient Occlusion (AO) Map:</b> Simulates the soft
                    shadows that occur in crevices, corners, and other areas
                    where ambient light is occluded or blocked. AO maps add
                    depth to your model by darkening areas where light is less
                    likely to reach, enhancing the sense of realism without the
                    need for complex lighting calculations.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <i className="fa-solid fa-arrow-right"></i>{" "}
                    <b>Color (Diffuse) Map:</b> Determines the base color of the
                    surface. This is the most straightforward type of texture
                    map, applying the main color to the object. It gives the
                    model its visual appearance in terms of color and basic
                    patterns.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <i className="fa-solid fa-arrow-right"></i>{" "}
                    <b>Height Map:</b> Represents the elevation or depth of the
                    surface. Height maps are often used for displacement
                    mapping, where the geometry is physically altered based on
                    the values in the texture. High values raise the surface,
                    while low values create depressions, adding actual depth and
                    complexity to the surface.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <i className="fa-solid fa-arrow-right"></i>{" "}
                    <b>Roughness Map:</b> Controls the smoothness or roughness
                    of the surface. Roughness maps influence how light interacts
                    with the surface by determining how sharp or blurred
                    reflections appear. A surface with high roughness will
                    scatter light more, appearing dull and matte, while a low
                    roughness value will create a glossy, reflective surface.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <i className="fa-solid fa-arrow-right"></i>{" "}
                    <b>Metalness Map:</b> Defines which parts of the surface are
                    metallic and which are non-metallic. Metalness maps help
                    simulate the reflective properties of metals. A value of 1
                    indicates a fully metallic surface that reflects its
                    environment and interacts with light differently than
                    non-metals. A value of 0 means the surface behaves like a
                    non-metallic material, often paired with a roughness map to
                    achieve realistic effects.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <i className="fa-solid fa-arrow-right"></i>{" "}
                    <b>Normal Map:</b> Adds fine detail to the surface without
                    changing the actual geometry. Normal maps simulate small
                    surface details such as bumps, wrinkles, or grooves by
                    altering the way light interacts with the surface. They give
                    the illusion of complex surface detail while keeping the
                    underlying geometry simple.
                  </li>

                    <b>Emissive Map:</b> Makes parts of the surface appear to
                    emit light. Emissive maps make certain areas of the texture
                    glow as if they are self-illuminated, independent of the
                    sceneâ€™s lighting. This effect is commonly used for things
                    like glowing screens, neon signs, or any element that needs
                    to appear as a light source.

                initialize the project by creating a Vite app.

              <p>
                We already have the base setup from our starter code, which
                includes creating a scene, setting up a camera, and adding a
                simple rotating cube. But now, weâ€™re going to level up by adding
                textures, loading them correctly, and applying them to our
                mysterious sci-fi box.

                <span>Step 1:</span> Add OrbitControls
              </h4>
              <p>
                Before diving into textures, letâ€™s enhance the user experience
                by allowing camera control. OrbitControls will enable you to
                rotate around the scene, zoom in, and pan, providing a more
                interactive way to explore the 3D scene.
              </p>
              <CodeSnippet
                language={"javascript"}
                codeText={orbitControlsText}
                theme={theme}
              />
              <br />
              <p>
                With this, you can now click and drag to rotate around your
                scene. Try it out!

              <h4>
                <span>Step 2:</span> Managing Texture Loading
              </h4>
              <p>
                Textures are an essential part of making our sci-fi box look
                realistic. But loading textures can sometimes be tricky,
                especially when dealing with multiple files. Thatâ€™s where
                LoadingManager comes into play.
              </p>
              <CodeSnippet
                language={"javascript"}
                codeText={textureLoader}
                theme={theme}
              />
              <p>
                Weâ€™ve set up a LoadingManager to handle the process and log
                different stages of texture loading. This will help you debug
                any issues or delays during loading.
              </p>
              <h4>
                <span>Step 3:</span> Loading the Textures
              </h4>
              <p>
                Now, letâ€™s load the textures. These textures will give our box a
                sci-fi feel, with metallic surfaces, glowing lights, and
                intricate details. Weâ€™ll load each texture using the
                TextureLoader and store them in a textureMap object for easy
                access.
              </p>
              <CodeSnippet
                language={"javascript"}
                codeText={textureLoader2}
                theme={theme}
              />
              <p>
                Weâ€™ve used placeholder URLs for the textures, but you can
                replace them with your own images if you like. The textures are
                now loaded and ready to be applied to our box.
              </p>
              <h4>
                <span>Step 4:</span> Setting Texture Properties
              </h4>
              <p>
                Not all textures are created equal. Some need to be repeated
                across a surface, while others should remain static. Weâ€™ll set
                properties for our textures to ensure they display correctly.
              </p>
              <CodeSnippet
                language={"javascript"}
                codeText={textureLoader3}
                theme={theme}
              />
              <p>
                These settings ensure that our color texture repeats across the
                surface and retains sharp details, perfect for the metallic,
                detailed look of a sci-fi box.
              </p>
              <h4>
                <span>Step 5:</span> Creating the Sci-Fi Box
              </h4>
              <p>
                Now comes the fun partâ€”applying the textures to our box! Weâ€™ll
                use MeshStandardMaterial because it supports all the different
                maps we want to use (e.g., normal, roughness, metalness, etc.).
              </p>
              <CodeSnippet
                language={"javascript"}
                codeText={textureApply}
                theme={theme}
              />
              <p>
                This code adds multiple layers of detail to our box, making it
                look like itâ€™s straight out of a sci-fi movie. Each map
                contributes to the final lookâ€”whether itâ€™s the metallic sheen or
                the glowing edges.
              </p>
              <h4>
                <span>Step 6:</span> UV Mapping for Ambient Occlusion
              </h4>
              <p>
                To ensure that our Ambient Occlusion (AO) map is applied
                correctly, we need to set up a second set of UV coordinates.
                This step is crucial for adding depth and realism to the shadows
                on our box.
              </p>
              <CodeSnippet
                language={"javascript"}
                codeText={AOAttrib}
                theme={theme}
              />
              <p>
                This simple line of code will allow the AO map to interact with
                the geometry correctly, giving those subtle shadows that make a
                world of difference.
              </p>
              <h4>
                <span>Step 7:</span> Adding Interactive Lighting
              </h4>
              <p>
                Lighting can make or break your 3D scene. We already have
                directional and ambient light set up, but letâ€™s tweak it a bit
                to enhance the overall effect.
              </p>
              <CodeSnippet
                language={"javascript"}
                codeText={lights}
                theme={theme}
              />
              <p>
                These lights ensure that our textures pop, creating a dynamic
                and immersive experience.

                UV Unwrapping: An Introduction
              </h3>
              <p>
                While itâ€™s quite logical how to place a texture on a cubeâ€”where
                each face corresponds directly to a square section of the
                textureâ€”things can get a little trickier for more complex
                geometries. You might ask, "What if I have a complex 3D model?
                How do I add a texture to it?"
                <br />
                This is where UV unwrapping becomes essential.
              </p>
              <b>The Challenge with Complex Models</b>
              <p>
                Imagine youâ€™re working with a 3D model of a character, an
                intricate vehicle, or a detailed landscape. Unlike a cube, these
                models donâ€™t have simple, flat surfaces that directly match a
                texture image. If you were to apply a texture without any
                preparation, the result could be chaoticâ€”stretched, squished, or
                misaligned textures that make the model look unprofessional.
              </p>
              <p>
                UV unwrapping solves this problem by converting the complex 3D
                surface into a 2D layout that can be easily textured. Without UV
                unwrapping, applying textures to complex models would be nearly
                impossible to control, resulting in distorted or misplaced
                details. UV unwrapping gives you the control needed to ensure
                your textures look natural and professional, even on the most
                intricate 3D shapes.
              </p>
              <p>
                You can actually see those UV 2D coordinates in the
                geometry.attributes.uv property:
              </p>
              <CodeSnippet
                codeText={`console.log(geometry.attributes.uv)`}
                language="js"
                theme={theme}
              />
              <p>
                These UV coordinates are automatically created by Three.js for
                built-in primitives. However, if you create custom geometry,
                you'll need to manually specify the UV coordinates. If you're
                using 3D software to model the geometry, you'll need to perform
                UV unwrapping to ensure proper texture mapping.
