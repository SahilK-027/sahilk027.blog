  Just four? I know, it's like trying to pick just one flavor of ice cream at an all-you-can-eat buffet - impossible! But hey, I've managed to narrow the list down to these four gems amidst the vast sea of creativity out there. 
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But wait, don't worry! I've got a long list of other jaw-dropping projects that deserve their moment in the spotlight. It's like having a playlist with endless hits, but for web development. So, to keep this blog on track and avoid going down the rabbit hole, I've limited myself to just these four. But hey, I promise to spill the beans on all the other mind-blowing projects I've stumbled upon.

    <ul>
      <li>
        <i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-right"></i>
        <b>Field of View (75): </b> The field of view is the extent of the observable world that is seen at any given moment. It's specified in degrees along the vertical axis. A higher value results in a wider field of view, providing a more expansive view of the 3D scene.
      </li>
      <li>
        <i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-right"></i>
        <b>Aspect Ratio (window.innerWidth / window.innerHeight): </b> The aspect ratio is the ratio of the camera's width to its height. It is typically set to the width of the browser window divided by the height, ensuring that the scene appears undistorted based on the dimensions of the viewing area.
      </li>
      <li>
        <i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-right"></i>
        <b>Near Clipping Plane (0.1): </b> The near clipping plane represents the closest distance from the camera at which objects are visible.
      </li>
      <li>
        <i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-right"></i>
        <b>Far Clipping Plane (1000): </b> The far clipping plane is the farthest distance at which objects are visible. Objects beyond this distance won't be rendered.

              Have you ever looked at a website and thought, "How on earth did
              they make this magic happen? 😲" Well, I can relate to that, I was
              constantly amazed by some mesmerising websites built by creative
              French developers. Yeah, I am saying “French” and that’s for a
              reason. In France, there are a lot of creative web dev studios.

              for me was always like stepping into a candy store of inspiration.
              In my free time, I'd linger there, watching the pixelated wonders
              and dreaming of creating my own masterpiece.

                    So in 2023, I was building my first 3D website{" "}

                    </a>{" "}
                    , all excited. The canvas and background both were black. I
                    imported the 3D model of a fighter drone (Trinity bot as we
                    call it) and added it to the scene. But wait, where is it? I
                    was confused, what did I do wrong? I was left scratching my
                    head for hours, changing the blender export setting,
                    deleting the imported file, and re-importing it. But nothing
                    was actually happening.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Hours passed by, and I was trying to figure out the mystery.
                    Why is my model invisible? Then, I read a post on the
                    internet. Someone had dropped a simple truth bomb – "Don't
                    forget the lights.”
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Lights? Really? I add lights to the scene, and boom! There
                    it is – my 3D model, finally visible. I can almost hear a
                    cheer from my computer. Lesson learned: Lights are like the
                    sunshine for 3D stuff. Without them, your creations are just
                    hiding in the shadows. So, note to self and fellow coders:
                    When things go invisible, turn on the lights! 🌟😅
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Lights and shadows add realism and depth to your 3D scene If
                    it’s not already dark.

                for modern web projects. Run the following commands in your CLI:

                After console logging the the THREE variable you can notice it
                contains most of the classes and properties you might need on a
                Three.js project. Unfortunately, not all classes are inside this

                The camera is not visible. It's more like a theoretical point of
                view. When we will do a render of your scene, it will be from
                that camera's point of view.
                <br />
                <br />
                You can have multiple cameras just like on a movie set, and you
                can switch between those cameras as you please. Usually, we only
                use one camera.
                <br />
                <br />
                There are different types of cameras, and we will talk about
                these in a future lesson. For now, we simply need a camera that
                handles perspective (making close objects look more prominent
                than far objects).

              <h4>
                <span>Step 8:</span> Renderer
              </h4>
              <p>
                The renderer's job is to do the render. Bet you didn't see that
                coming!
                <br />
                <br />
                We will simply ask the renderer to render our scene from the
                camera's point of view, and the result will be drawn into a
                canvas. You can create the canvas by yourself, or let the
                renderer generate it and then add it to your page. For this
                exercise, we will add the canvas to the HTML and send it to the
                renderer.

              <h4>
                <span>Step 9:</span> Update the renderer on each frame
              </h4>
              <p>
                In real-time 3D applications, it's crucial to continuously
                render the scene to provide smooth visual updates. This loop
                ensures that the scene is redrawn at the appropriate frame rate,
                typically 60 frames per second (FPS) for smooth animations.
                <br />
                <br />
                By updating the position, rotation, and other properties of
                objects in the scene gradually over time (based on deltaTime),
                animations appear smooth and natural to the viewer's eye.
                Without this time-based approach, animations might appear choppy
                or inconsistent, especially on devices with varying frame rates.
