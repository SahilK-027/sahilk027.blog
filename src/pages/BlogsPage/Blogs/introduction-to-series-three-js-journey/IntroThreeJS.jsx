              excited to have you here. This isn't your usual informative blog
              post, instead, it's an opportunity for me to share my thoughts and

                The main reason for this lengthy introduction is the fact that
                this blog series is going to be quite big. It’s my commitment to

                . Yep, you heard it right. This is going to be a comprehensive
                guide that will help you understand the intricate puzzle of 3D
                development. Now, you're probably wondering why I'm doing this.
                Well, I'll be honest with you - <span>I just love writing</span>
                ! 😆 But that's not the only reason.
              </p>
              <p>
                Yes, there are many reasons behind writing a technical blog
                series revolving around one specific topic. But let me take you
                back to where it all began. When I started learning Three.js and
                WebGL, I struggled a lot at first. Don't get me wrong – the{" "}
                <a
                  href="https://discourse.threejs.org/"
                  target="_blank"

                >
                  Three.js community
                </a>{" "}
                is fantastic, but even with their support, I still found myself
                wandering through endless internet rabbit holes, searching for
                wisdom to piece together the intricate puzzle of 3D development.
              </p>
              <p>
                All right, picture this: you've got this brilliant idea for a
                website, right? But there's one tiny hitch – you want to add
                these mind-blowing fluid simulations, and you're like, "Um,
                how?" That's exactly where I found myself with my recent
                project,{" "}
                <a
                  href="https://trinity-2024.vercel.app"
                  target="_blank"

                . After searching the vast expanse of the internet and digging
                through countless blog posts, I stumbled upon a gem of wisdom
                that lit up my path. It was like finding the missing puzzle
                piece!
              </p>
              <p>
                I built the website eventually, but it took me a lot of time to
                do so. And that got me thinking - why keep all this hard-earned
                knowledge to myself when I could share it with all of you? As a
                software developer, I believe that once you know the{" "}
                <span>why and what of something</span>, the <span>how</span>{" "}
                should never be an obstacle standing in the way of doing it. And
                that's why I'm writing this blog series.

                All right, let me talk about myself for a second. I'm Sahil, a
                <span>front-end developer</span>, although I prefer to call
                myself a <span>creative web developer</span>. I've always been
                fascinated by the amazing websites people create, and watching
                them made me want to build something similar. I've been
                exploring the world of web development for a year and a half
                now, and with that, I learned lots of new technologies and built
                some awesome projects along the way! So with this blog page, I
                want to share my experiences and discoveries with you. I don't
                just build cool front-ends, though. I also work on{" "}
