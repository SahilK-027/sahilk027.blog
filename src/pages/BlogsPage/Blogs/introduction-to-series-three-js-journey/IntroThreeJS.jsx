                    comprehensive guide that will help you understand the

                    wondering why I'm doing this. Well, I'll be honest with you
                    - <span>I just love writing</span>! 😆 But that's not the

                    Yes, there are many reasons behind writing a technical blog
                    series revolving around one specific topic. But let me take
                    you back to where it all began. When I started learning
                    Three.js and WebGL, I struggled a lot at first. Don't get me
                    wrong – the{" "}

                    is fantastic, but even with their support, I still found
                    myself wandering through endless internet rabbit holes,
                    searching for wisdom to piece together the intricate puzzle
                    of 3D development.

                    All right, picture this: you've got this brilliant idea for
                    a website, you want to create mesmerising user interactive
                    landing page. After thnking for a while, you get an idea
                    "let's add mind-blowing fluid simulations, you are exited
                    but suddenly you're like, "Umm, but how?" That's exactly
                    where I found myself with my recent project,{" "}

                    . After searching the vast expanse of the internet and
                    digging through countless blog posts, I stumbled upon a gem
                    of wisdom that lit up my path. It was like finding the
                    missing puzzle piece!

                  <p>
                    I built the website eventually, but it took me a lot of time
                    to do so. And that got me thinking - why keep all this
                    hard-earned knowledge to myself when I could share it with
                    all of you? As a software developer, I believe that once you
                    know the <span>why and what of something</span>, the{" "}
                    <span>how</span> should never be an obstacle standing in the
                    way of doing it. And that's why I'm writing this blog
                    series.
